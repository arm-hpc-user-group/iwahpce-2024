#  International Workshop on Arm-based HPC: Practice and Experience (IWAHPCE-2024)
to be held in conjunction with The International Conference on High Performance Computing in Asia-Pacific Region ([HPC Asia 2024](https://sighpc.ipsj.or.jp/HPCAsia2024/)), Japan, Jan 25 - 27, 2024 


### Workshop Overview
This workshop aims to provide the opportunity to share the practice and experience of high-performance computing systems using the Arm architecture and their performance and applications.The last few years have seen an explosion of 64-bit Arm-based processors targeted toward server and infrastructure workloads, often specializing in a specific domain such as HPC, cloud, and machine learning. Fujitsu's A64FX and Marvell's ThunderX2 have been used in several large-scale HPC systems, and Amazon's Graviton2 has been adopted by Amazon EC2. Moreover, Amazon's Graviton3, NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchip, and SiPearl's Rhea system-on-chip are recently announced or become accessible.Sharing the practice and experiences using these Arm-based processors will contribute to advancing high-performance computing technology for newly designed systems using these new emerging Arm-based processors.
